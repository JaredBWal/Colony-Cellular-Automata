<h1>Colony-Cellular-Automata</h1>
<p>A program that simulates the growth and fall of colonies using cellular automata</p>

<h1>What I learned/ worked on</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Introduction to JFrame GUI</li>
    <li>Program optimization with 100,000s of objects</li>
    <li>Re-reading and implementing new code months after working on project</li>
    <li> Working with class objects and two-dimensional object arrays
  </ul>

<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<p>I would like to give appriection to "Hopson" for his C++ cellular automata project. This was one of the first projects that got me interested in programming. I would use some of his core ideas in my Java project, while also adding more functions and ideas of my own.</p>
